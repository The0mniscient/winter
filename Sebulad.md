# BUILDING AN RC CAR – BRINGING TOGETHER ELECTORNICS AND FLUID MECHANICS

## Project Overview
We are going to build a high-speed RC car with the aim of optimising the body car shape to maximise its speed. This will be achieved by completing fluid simulations in Fusion 360 to optimise the aerodynamics on the shell. To manufacture the shell we will employ FDM 3D printing in a range of materials, furthermore, we will utilise our school's CNC machine to experiment in other materials such as polycarbonate, acrylic etc... We will also complete generative design studies to generate a chassis that is both lightweight and strong.

As a group, we are extremely excited to complete this build as it brings together our love for electronics whilst providing a fulfilling challenge. Furthermore, by employing a range of manufacturing techniques to build the shell of the car we can learn about how different CNC machines work and the advantages / disadvantages of different manufacturing techniques.

## A focus on Electronics
Although this project has a heavy focus on understanding what factors affect the aerodynamics of a cars speed, we also want to get stuck into some electronics. We found that the best way to assemble the RC car whilst not getting bogged down by overcomplicated electronics and wiring was to purchase a disassembled chasis of an RC!
car and heavily modify it to suit our needs: both ensuring that the manufacturing process of the electronics will be relatively smooth and allow us to disassemble and reassemble it to understand how it works.

**How we plan for the electronics to work together: a high-level overview.**
The RC Car / Chasis / ESC section in out budget encompasses the required parts in that. By disassembling it we hope to further understand the inner workings of electronics required.

## A focus on Aerodynamics
We want the shell to resemble an F1 car as we want our RC car to be as fast as possible in a straight line in perfect conditions (no wind, ideal smooth racetrack). We want to accomplish this without using a "better" motor therefore we can make the car faster by making it slicker (aerodynamics). 

To decrease the air resistance, we need to have the smallest possible cross-sectional area. We can accomplish this by reducing the height of our shell as much as possible. However, we also need to consider the how air can move round our car smoothly, for example if we were to make our shell a square, there would be a greater drag as a square is not an aerodynamically smooth shape, reducing efficiency and reducing top speed. Instead, our shell should be as smooth as a curve we can make it whilst fitting the electronics and chassis. This smooth shape will allow the air to flow over the car with little drag as possible as shown in the diagram.

We will also use a front wing to direct the air flow around the car allowing the air to flow smoothly, alternatively a rain-drop shape would also produce the effect of lease air resistance as it allows air to flow smoothly round the car with little resistance and low drag, however this is not practical as would not fit our chassis inside. Instead, we can combine these ideas to make a front wing that fits our car whilst creating the streamline affect (elongated rain-drop design).

Rear wings in F1 cars are used to direct the wind flow above the car thus giving the car more downforce so they can turn round corners at high speeds. Although we do not need to turn corners, we still need to have high downforce to get the best friction so that our motors can work at optimum efficiency. Wings also reduce the aerodynamic smoothness of the car thus slowing the car down (which is why F1 cars open their rear wing on the straight, leaving gap to decrease the drag but still have stability). Therefore, our rear wing should have a very slight angle at about 20° to the horizontal and be thin. This allows for our car to have increased downforce without gaining too much drag and ruining the aerodynamics of the car.
